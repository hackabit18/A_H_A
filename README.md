Smart Street Lighting system using IOT.

ABSTRUCT::

We have designed a solar powered smart streetlight system which can be remotely monitored from a main center. The excess power generated from the solar panels on each streetlight will be used to set up power charging stations for electric cars.
The solar panels will rotate with respect to the sun's position during daytime for maximum efficiency. At night, the lights will be dimmed to 33.3% of their power and when ultrasound sensors detect motion, they'll light up accordingly. The excess power from each streetlight will be stored in a main battery which will power a charging station, set up at suitable distances apart.
This excess power maybe used for other purposes, like in rural areas, as a means of electricity generation and such unique cases.
